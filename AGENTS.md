# AGENTS.md — working with COROS or Garmin data in this repo

Guide for AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, …) operating this repository. Read it fully once per session.

## Session start — always list the features first

Your **first reply of every session** starts with this short menu, in the athlete's language (keep the emojis,
one line each), before anything else:

```
Here is what I can do with your COROS / Garmin data:
1. 📊 Analyse — activities, laps, sleep, HRV, resting HR, training load ("how did my week go?")
2. ⌚ Create a workout on your watch — "4×1000 at 4:05 today, 2' rest"            (run-workout)
3. 🗓️ Build an adaptive training plan — goal, weeks, sessions/week, time budget   (run-coach)
4. 🔄 Review and adapt the plan — "update my plan", missed sessions, fatigue       (run-coach)
5. 🚦 What should I do today? — readiness (HRV, RHR, sleep, load) → today's session (run-coach)
6. 📝 Training report — progress, adherence, load, fitness vs goal                 (run-report)
```

Use the brand name of the active provider in the first line ("your COROS data" or "your Garmin data"). For Garmin,
item 2 reads "⌚ Create a workout for your watch (via intervals.icu → Garmin Connect, or a .fit file)".

Then add one status line from quick checks (at most one provider call, no data fetching):

- Provider: `COACH_PROVIDER`, else `provider:` in `athlete/profile.yaml`, else COROS if `.vendor/COROS-MCP` exists,
  else Garmin if a Garmin key exists (`$GARMIN_PERSONAL_API_KEY` or `~/.config/garmin/connect-personal-api-key`).
  Nothing set up yet → ask once: "COROS or Garmin?".
- COROS: `.venv/bin/python scripts/coros.py status` → "connected as …", or "not connected → I can run the setup
  (you will just have to open a login link)" if `.venv/`/`.vendor/` are missing or the login expired.
  If COROS tools are available natively (`mcp__coros__*` connector), say "connected via the COROS connector".
- Garmin: `.venv/bin/python scripts/garmin.py status` → "Garmin connected", or "not connected → create a Personal API
  key at https://connect.garmin.com/app/settings/personalApiToken and I will set it up". Add "workouts via
  intervals.icu" if an intervals.icu key exists (`$INTERVALS_API_KEY` or `~/.config/intervals/api-key`), else
  "workouts as .fit files (intervals.icu not set up)".
- Plans: the folders in `plans/` whose dates include today ("active plan: …"), or "no plan yet".

Then handle the athlete's first message. If it was only a greeting, end with one question: "What would you like to
do?". Show the menu again whenever the athlete asks for "menu", "help", "what can you do", "aide"…

## What this repo is

Tools + skills to use the athlete's **COROS** account through the official **COROS MCP** server, or their
**Garmin** account through Garmin's official **Personal API** (read-only): read activities/health/fitness data,
create workouts for the watch, and run an adaptive training plan. `scripts/source.py` hides the difference: plan,
readiness and report code receives the same data shapes from both.

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `scripts/source.py` | provider switch (COROS / Garmin) → normalized activities, HRV, RHR, sleep, recovery, load, fitness |
| `scripts/coros.py` | call any COROS MCP tool (wraps the official helper in `.vendor/`) |
| `scripts/parsers.py` | parse COROS text outputs into data |
| `scripts/garmin.py` | call a read-only Garmin Personal API endpoint (official client) |
| `scripts/garmin_parsers.py` | parse Garmin JSON into the same data shapes |
| `scripts/fitworkout.py` | course JSON → Garmin FIT workout file, and its checking pipeline |
| `scripts/intervals.py` | Garmin: planned workouts → intervals.icu → Garmin Connect calendar |
| `scripts/workout.py` | COROS: validate → create/update → read back one scheduled workout · Garmin: `send` (intervals.icu) or `export` (FIT file) |
| `scripts/plan.py` | plan engine: init / validate / render / push (COROS calendar or FIT export) / sync / profile / readiness / zones |
| `scripts/readiness.py` | deterministic readiness score + pace zones + Garmin substitutes (TRIMP load ratio, Riegel threshold) |
| `scripts/recap.py` | HTML recap of one session: FIT laps vs planned steps, HR drift, zones, readiness + coach `recap:` block |
| `scripts/week.py` | HTML board of one plan week: its sessions with workout detail, done vs planned, weekly volume chart |
| `scripts/report.py` | draft a training-status report (markdown with `<!-- COACH -->` placeholders) |
| `scripts/telegram.py` | send recaps (HTML), reports (markdown → text), images or a short message to the athlete's Telegram chat |
| `.claude/skills/run-workout/` | skill: build one workout from natural language |
| `.claude/skills/run-coach/` | skill: endurance coach (plan, push, review, adapt) |
| `.claude/skills/run-report/` | skill: current-state training report (read-only) |
| `docs/mcp-reference.md` | **all 34 COROS tools, formats, units, limits, quirks** |
| `docs/garmin-reference.md` | Garmin Personal API: endpoints used, computed substitutes, FIT export and its limits |
| `docs/course-json.md` | workout JSON format |
| `docs/coaching-science.md` | training rules with sources |
| `athlete/profile.yaml` | athlete baseline + preferences (generated by `plan.py profile`, preferences edited by hand) — **git-ignored** |
| `athlete/profile.example.yaml` | what a profile looks like (fictional athlete) |
| `plans/<slug>/` | `plan.yaml` (truth) · `plan.md` (generated) · `journal.md` (log) · `reports/` — **git-ignored** |
| `reports/` | reports made without a plan — **git-ignored** |
| `exports/` | Garmin FIT workout files — **git-ignored** |

## Setup (once per machine/container)

```bash
scripts/setup.sh                                  # clones coroslab/COROS-MCP into .vendor/, creates .venv, starts login
.venv/bin/python scripts/coros.py login-finish    # after the user opened the link and signed in
.venv/bin/python scripts/coros.py status          # → "COROS MCP OK — logged in as …"
```

- Login is a browser flow: the script prints a `https://mcp{eu,us,cn}.coros.com/cli/login/…` link. Give it to the
  user, then run `login-finish` (in the background — it polls up to 15 min). **Never ask for the COROS password**,
  never print tokens. Tokens live in `~/.coros-mcp-skill-gateway/<region>/`, outside the repo, and auto-refresh.
- In an ephemeral container the login is lost when the container is recycled: re-run setup and ask the user to log
  in again.
- Alternative: if the COROS MCP is configured as a native connector (`https://mcp.coros.com/mcp`), its tools can be
  called directly; keep using `plan.py` for plan logic (it needs the helper login, though).

### Garmin

```bash
scripts/setup.sh --garmin                         # .venv with the Garmin client (Python >= 3.12), stores the key
.venv/bin/python scripts/garmin.py status         # → "Garmin Personal API OK — …"
```

- The athlete creates the key at <https://connect.garmin.com/app/settings/personalApiToken>. They paste it into
  `setup.sh --garmin` (hidden input) themselves; **never ask them to paste it in the chat**, never print it.
  It is stored in `~/.config/garmin/connect-personal-api-key` (mode 600) or read from `$GARMIN_PERSONAL_API_KEY`.
- Read-only: there is no Garmin write, and Garmin Connect cannot import workout files. Workouts reach Garmin Connect
  through **intervals.icu** (`scripts/setup.sh --intervals`, then `workout.py send` / `plan.py push`), or become FIT
  files (`workout.py export`, `plan.py push --files`) that the athlete copies to `GARMIN/NewFiles/` on the watch.
  Same rule for the intervals.icu key as for the Garmin key: the athlete pastes it into the setup script, never in
  the chat. See `docs/garmin-reference.md`.
- No VO2max / threshold / load / recovery from Garmin: the scripts compute substitutes and label them
  (`fitness_source`, "Body Battery", computed load ratio). Say "estimated" when you quote them.

### Telegram (optional delivery channel)

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/telegram.py status                           # → "Telegram OK — bot @… → chat …"
.venv/bin/python scripts/telegram.py send plans/<slug>/recaps/<file>.html --caption "Recap — Tue intervals"
.venv/bin/python scripts/telegram.py send plans/<slug>/reports/<date>.md   # markdown → plain text messages
.venv/bin/python scripts/telegram.py text "Today: easy 40', HRV low"
```

- Token in `~/.config/telegram/bot-token`, chat id in `~/.config/telegram/chat-id` (mode 600), or
  `$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `$TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Never print the token. `telegram.py chat-id` finds the id after the
  athlete messages the bot once.
- When Telegram is configured, offer to send each recap / report you finish ("Send it to Telegram?"); send only
  finished files (no `<!-- COACH -->` placeholders left). The chat is the athlete's own: this is not "public".

## Calling tools

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/coros.py tools                  # names, read/write
.venv/bin/python scripts/coros.py describe querySleepHrv # live description + JSON schema
.venv/bin/python scripts/coros.py call queryFitnessAssessmentOverview
.venv/bin/python scripts/coros.py call querySleepHrv '{"startDate":"20261001","endDate":"20261003","days":3}'
```

Garmin: `.venv/bin/python scripts/garmin.py endpoints` / `call NAME '{"start_date": "…", "end_date": "…"}'`.

Raw responses are cached in `.cache/mcp/` and `.cache/garmin/` (git-ignored). Before using an unfamiliar tool, `describe` it — the server
evolves faster than its README.

## Essentials about the COROS MCP (details in docs/mcp-reference.md)

- 34 tools: activities (records, detail, laps, custom windows, FIT), health (daily, sleep, sleep HRV, HR, RHR,
  stress, health checks, recovery, cycle), fitness (VO2max, threshold pace, race predictions, training load),
  calendar/plans/library (read + **write**), profile/devices.
- Outputs are mostly LLM-oriented text; lap data is JSON with Chinese labels, distances in cm, pace in s/km.
- `querySportRecords` needs all 10 arguments (nulls ok) and returns ≤ 100 records.
- Sleep/HRV are dated by wake-up day. Use `querySleepHrv` for HRV readiness (official normal range).
- Write tools: create/update scheduled workouts, library workouts, training plans — **running, cycling, trail only**,
  dates today→+90 days, **no delete/move**, no duplicate protection, plans synced from TrainingPeaks are read-only.
- FIT download URLs work without authentication — never paste them anywhere public.

## Rules of engagement

1. **Read-only by default.** Any write (create/update/schedule on COROS, intervals.icu or FIT export for Garmin) needs an explicit
   request from the user in the conversation. Dry-run first (`workout.py … ` / `plan.py push` without `--yes`), show
   what will be written, then run with `--yes`.
2. Never retry a failed write without checking the calendar (`workout.py day DATE`).
3. Never show internal IDs (`labelId`, `idInPlan`, `activityId`, plan/workout IDs), tokens or API keys to the user.
4. **Personal data never goes public.** This repository is a public template: `athlete/profile.yaml`, `plans/*/`,
   `reports/`, `exports/` and `.cache/` are git-ignored because they hold the athlete's health data. Do not send them to other
   services, issues or PR descriptions. See *Persistence* below before committing any of them.
5. `plan.md` is generated: edit `plan.yaml`, then `plan.py render`.
6. Before committing: `.venv/bin/ruff check . && .venv/bin/pytest -q`. Work on a branch, open a PR; never push to
   `main`, never force-push.

## Persistence of personal data

Plans, profile and reports are local files. To keep them across machines/containers, the athlete needs a **private**
copy of this repo. Commit them only if the athlete agrees **and** the repo is private:

```bash
gh repo view --json visibility -q .visibility    # must print PRIVATE (if it fails or prints PUBLIC: do not commit)
git add -f athlete/profile.yaml plans/<slug>/          # -f: git-ignored on purpose (+ reports/ if it exists)
```

Commit on a branch and open/update a PR (never `main`). In a public repo (forks of a public repo are public too),
keep them local and tell the athlete once that they are not saved in git.

## Skills

- **run-workout** — "create a 4×1000 at 4:05 for today": builds the course JSON, validates, confirms, creates,
  reads back. See `.claude/skills/run-workout/SKILL.md`.
- **run-coach** — "build me a 10-week half-marathon plan, 5 sessions/week", "how did my week go?", "what should I
  do today?": plan → push → sync → adapt loop. See `.claude/skills/run-coach/SKILL.md`.
- **run-report** — "give me a report on my training / where am I in my plan?": `scripts/report.py` drafts the
  numbers (progress, adherence, key sessions, volume, load, readiness, fitness vs goal, next 7 days), the agent writes
  the assessment. Read-only. See `.claude/skills/run-report/SKILL.md`.

Agents without native skill support: read the relevant `SKILL.md` and follow it as instructions.
